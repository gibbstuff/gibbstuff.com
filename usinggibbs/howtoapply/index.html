        <h1>Gibbs is Easy to Apply</h1>
        <p>If possible, start with a clean surface. Spray a small amount of Gibbs Brand in a few streaks across the area that you’re working on. Then, use a clean paper towel to gently wipe the Gibbs over the entire surface that you want to protect. You can then use another clean paper towel to lightly wipe off any excess. Whenever you’re using Gibbs, always wipe gently with a very light pressure, leaving it where it’s needed. As soon as any clean, bare metal has been treated as explained above, you can touch it with a dirty, sweaty hand, without leaving a stain.</p>

        <p>Put a couple of drops of Gibbs Brand as close as possible to the area where it’s needed. Gibbs Brand begins to work right away. In cases where fasteners or parts are completely frozen, use as above and then apply another couple of drops of Gibbs Brand a day later. If at all possible, wait until the third day to carefully free up the parts.</p>
